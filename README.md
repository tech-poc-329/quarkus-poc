Given the JiraBot service needs to ensure reliability and maintainability,
When comprehensive unit tests are implemented covering core functionalities, edge cases, and error handling, and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with at least 80% code coverage,
Then the service will reliably catch bugs early, handle errors gracefully, and maintain high-quality standards through automated testing.
